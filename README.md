# Non-Linear-Data-Structures

For the following Binary Tree data structure, my task was to program the Algorithms that allow you to iterate and search the tree 
for a result.

For the following Adjacency Matrix Graph and Adjacency List Graph, I was tasked with devising algorithms to print the graphs, add to them etc. The only section of the data structure algorithms I wasn't able to completely solve was the getDegree() method however everything else
works perfectly.
